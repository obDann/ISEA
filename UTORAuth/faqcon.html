  <img src="https://tcard.utoronto.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Terry-Lee-TCard-2019.jpg" style="width:50%;height:50%;">
  <p>Alternatively, if you know your UTORmail address and password, you can go to the UTORid website and click on “get information”. Enter your email name (without the @utoronto.ca) and your password.</p>
